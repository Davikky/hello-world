# hello-world
<b>Here is a basic intro to GitHub!</b>\
I am Victor Adeyemi, a Quantum Computing Enthusiast with interest in research and learning.\
I have learnt and am yet learing the basics of QC by participating in courses/training such as:\
  #The Coding School: Introduction to Quantum Computing (sponsored by IBM) 2020;\
  #Fraunhofer Academy: Quantum Computing Professional Basic level Training 2022;\
  #IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2022.\
I am open to opportunities to learn and collaborate with researchers on any QC related project.
