# hello-world
Here is a basic intro to GitHub!
I am Victor Adeyemi, a Quantum Computing Enthusiast with interest in <research> and #learning.
I have learnt and am yet learing the basics of QC by participating in courses/training such as:
#The Coding School: Introduction to Quantum Computing (sponsored by IBM) 2020
#Fraunhofer Academy: Quantum Computing Professional Basic level Training 2022
#IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2022.
I am open to opportunities to learn and collaborate with researchers on any QC related project.
